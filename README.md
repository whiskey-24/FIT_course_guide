# FIT specialisation helper


# Usage
If you don't want to download all course and specialisation data from scratch, use pre-downloaded data in pkl files.
- You can display overview of all specialisation using function `overview_of_specs` from `FITCourseGuide` class.
It will display all courses, their guarantor and required courses in all semesters.
- Use function `help_me_decide` to aid selection of courses for given specialisation. It takes 2 arguments: abbreviation of 
specialisation and list of courses for every semester ([[Courses for first semester], [Courses for second semester]...]).
When choosing a course that can be enrolled in both the winter or summer semester, use the correct suffix `w` or `s` for 
the desired semester. For example, the course "FIT" can be enrolled in the winter semester as `FITw` or the summer semester as `FITs`.
- The `matrix.csv` generated by the `generate_matrix` function provides an overview of all specializations and their required courses.
